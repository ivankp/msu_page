Histogram data structure:
1) The first row contains the overflow value (events outside the histogram region). The value is not normalised to any bin size. 
2) Starting from the second row, the first three columns are the corresponding values of left edge, mean, and right edge of each histogram bin
3) The bulk of the data contains 14 columns, corresponding to the histogram values of 7 scale choices and with the MC integration error next to its main value. 
4) Except for the overflow row, all other histogram values and MC errors are normalised to the corresponding bin size as indicated in the fist three columns. 
5) The total cross section can be read from the njets histograms where the zero jet bin is always zero and there is no overflow data.
6) The data files are separated by different fixed orders: LO, NLO, NNLO, NLO_only (NLO-LO), NNLO_only (NNLO-NLO).
7) Some histograms are all zero that is just included for consistent checks. For example any 2nd and 3rd jet related observables for LO (pp-->H+1jet) are all zero.
